## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
HOW TO REDUCE E-WASTE The challenge of reducing e-waste is something everyone needs to become aware of and make a commitment to doing, and it starts with understanding why we don’t want our used electronics continuously flowing into community landfills.

Electronic waste is defined as discarded electrical or electronic devices that can lead to human and environmental damage if they get put in landfills. These devices contain toxic chemicals like mercury and lead, and while they’re safe to use once they get placed in a landfill those toxins can seep out into the soil and water, contaminating both. If those toxins get into your drinking water then that presents a health hazard for you and your family.

And this is no minor challenge. As technology evolves and keeps improving our electronics, giving us incentives to get rid of our current models for the newest one, there’s been a tendency to just throw away these products. This has created a serious global e-waste problem.

Reducing e-waste isn’t just about eliminating those environmental risks. Minimizing e-waste also helps us to conserve resources and reduces the amount of energy we need to make these products; recycling parts within e-waste uses considerably less energy than creating new ones.

We can also help keep down the cost of new consumer goods by using recycled parts to make new products. This is a far less expensive proposition for manufacturers than having to go mining for virgin ore to make new metals. This means that the cost of making a new smartphone, or any other electronic device, goes down once manufacturers are able to access the parts they need from the recycling industry.

So this is a win-win proposition all around. The challenge, of course, is that not enough people know that e-waste can be recycled.

That’s why one of the strongest and most effective ways on learning how to reduce e-waste is to help spread the word about recycling.

If you’re someone that already recycles your e-waste then it’s great that you’re already doing your part to reduce waste. Now it’s time to go the next step and share your knowledge with other people — family, friends, neighbors, coworkers — who may not be aware of the hazards that e-waste poses.

If you have a family member or friend that just got a new smartphone or laptop, or simply plans on disposing of their old ones, talk to them about recycling it with an experienced recycling firm like Great Lakes Electronics Corporation, which can make the parts within them available to new users and manufacturers.

It’s also important to share your knowledge on the detrimental impact of throwing those devices away, or even hoarding them, this gives people a reason to act on your advice. If your friends and family members appreciate recycling and faithfully toss their plastics, cans and papers in municipal bins, let them know how easy it is to recycle e-waste. They can easily call a recycling firm, like Great Lakes Electronics Corporation, and do the same with their e-waste.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

Nobody expects the amount of e-waste we generate to suddenly drop — in part because prices of new electronics are dropping, making them in much higher demand around the world, courtesy of a growing middle class in developing nations that’s going digital. After all, around the world half of all households have internet access, and more than 7.7 billion people have cell phones.

How can we stop the e-waste problem? The first is to keep all used electronic devices out of our trash and our landfills. The same is true for simply hoarding those devices in our closets or desk drawers, where the valuable properties within them sit unused. And there are proven solutions for reducing e-waste.
